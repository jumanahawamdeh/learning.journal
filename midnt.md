 * Your consistent beliefs will prevent you from making any positive change. If you have an attribute that you think you can't change, such as your intelligence, weight, or bad habits, you will avoid situations that may be uncomfortable or that you think are futile

 * Growth mentality, students believe that their abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, learning and perseverance. Their basic abilities are simply a starting point for their potential. They don't think everyone is the same, but they insist that everyone can get smarter if they try.
